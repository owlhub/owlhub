# Prisma and Prepared Statements

This document explains how Prisma handles prepared statements in the OwlHub application.

## Overview

Prisma ORM automatically uses prepared statements for all database queries by default. This provides several benefits:

1. **Security**: Protection against SQL injection attacks
2. **Performance**: Faster execution for repeated queries
3. **Efficiency**: Reduced parsing overhead on the database server

## How Prisma Uses Prepared Statements

When you use Prisma's query API (e.g., `findMany`, `create`, `update`), Prisma:

1. Generates a parameterized SQL query
2. Sends the query template to the database for preparation
3. Executes the prepared statement with the provided parameters
4. Caches the prepared statement for future use

This happens automatically without any additional configuration required.

## Current Configuration

In this project:

- We're using Prisma Client with its default configuration
- No custom raw query methods (`$queryRaw`, `executeRaw`) are being used
- All database operations use Prisma's standard query API

## Connection Pooling with PgBouncer

The application uses PgBouncer for connection pooling, as indicated by the `pgbouncer=true` parameter in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:6543/database?pgbouncer=true
```

When using PgBouncer with Prisma, there are some important considerations:

1. **Transaction Pooling Mode**: PgBouncer in transaction pooling mode has limitations with prepared statements because connections are returned to the pool after each transaction.

2. **Prisma's Handling**: The `pgbouncer=true` parameter in the connection string tells Prisma to:
   - Use simple queries instead of prepared statements for certain operations
   - Avoid features that don't work well with PgBouncer's transaction pooling mode

3. **Compatibility**: Prisma automatically adapts its behavior to ensure compatibility with PgBouncer.

## Best Practices

When working with Prisma and PgBouncer:

1. Keep the `pgbouncer=true` parameter in the connection string
2. Avoid using raw SQL queries when possible
3. Be aware that some advanced Prisma features might not work with PgBouncer in transaction pooling mode
4. Monitor query performance to ensure the configuration is optimal

## Conclusion

Prisma is using prepared statements by default for all standard queries in this application, with automatic adjustments made for PgBouncer compatibility. This provides a good balance of security, performance, and connection efficiency.
