# OwlHub Release Notes - v1.2.0

## Overview

OwlHub v1.2.0 further strengthens AWS security posture management with enhanced IAM checks focused on root user security and inactive user accounts. This release introduces additional security findings to help organizations identify and address critical security vulnerabilities related to AWS root user access and inactive IAM user accounts.

## Key Features

### Enhanced AWS Integration

#### Expanded Root User Security Checks

The AWS integration now includes comprehensive checks for AWS root user security, providing more thorough security posture assessment:

**New Security Findings:**
- **AWS Root User MFA Disabled**: Identifies when the AWS root user does not have Multi-Factor Authentication enabled, which is a critical security vulnerability
- **AWS Root User has Access Keys**: Detects when access keys exist for the root user, which is against AWS security best practices
- **AWS Root User Logged in within Last 90 Days**: Alerts when the root user account has been used recently, encouraging the use of IAM users with appropriate permissions instead

#### Enhanced IAM User Monitoring

**New Security Findings:**
- **IAM User Console Login Inactive Over 90 Days**: Identifies IAM users with console access that haven't logged in for over 90 days, helping to detect and remove unused accounts
- **IAM Account Password Policy Doesn't Require Passwords to Expire**: Detects password policies that don't enforce regular password rotation

These enhanced checks help organizations ensure their AWS accounts follow security best practices, particularly for the highly privileged root user account, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and account compromise.
