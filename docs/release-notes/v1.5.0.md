- **Comprehensive S3 Bucket Security Scanning**: Added detection for multiple S3 bucket security issues:
  - Public accessibility detection
  - Versioning status verification
  - Replication configuration validation
  - Server-side encryption verification
  - Access logging configuration checks
  - Lifecycle policy validation
  - Bucket policy existence verification
  - Object-level logging status checks
  - Encryption in transit (HTTPS) enforcement validation

  - Error handling and reporting for background processes
  - Job metadata storage and retrieval
  - Improved visibility into background process execution

#### Performance Optimizations

  - Improved resource utilization during security scanning
  - Automatic adjustment of concurrent operations based on system load
  - Enhanced error handling and recovery for batch operations

- **Client-Side Performance Improvements**:
  - Memoized `defaultFilters` in ClientWrapper to prevent unnecessary re-creation
  - Increased default rows per page in FindingsTable to 20 for better usability
  - Synchronized filters with URL query parameters for improved navigation
