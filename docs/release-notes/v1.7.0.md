# OwlHub Release Notes - v1.7.0

## Overview

OwlHub v1.7.0 introduces expanded AWS security scanning capabilities with new findings detection for EBS volumes, CloudFront distributions, RDS instances, and EC2 resources. This release also includes performance improvements for posture findings filtering and removal of unused components.

## Key Features

### AWS Integration Enhancements

#### Expanded Security Findings Detection

- **EBS Volume Optimization Detection**: Added detection for EBS volumes using gp2 instead of gp3
  - Identifies cost-saving opportunities by detecting volumes that could benefit from upgrading to the newer gp3 volume type
  - Provides detailed information about affected volumes including size, region, and associated resources

- **CloudFront Distribution Optimization**: Added detection for CloudFront distributions without compression enabled
  - Identifies distributions that could benefit from enabling compression for improved performance and reduced costs
  - Provides recommendations for optimizing CloudFront configuration

- **RDS Cost Optimization**: Added detection for RDS instances and clusters without matching Reserved Instances
  - Identifies on-demand RDS instances and clusters that could benefit from Reserved Instance pricing
  - Helps reduce costs for predictable database workloads

- **EC2 Resource Management**: Added detection for unattached ENIs and Elastic IPs
  - Identifies unused network interfaces and IP addresses that may be incurring unnecessary costs
  - Helps maintain a clean AWS environment by identifying orphaned resources

- **VPC Gateway Endpoint Detection**: Enhanced VPC scanning to detect missing Gateway Endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB
  - Identifies VPCs that could benefit from Gateway Endpoints to reduce data transfer costs and improve security
  - Builds upon the VPC security scanning capabilities introduced in v1.6.0

### Performance Improvements

- **Server-Side Filtering**: Switched posture findings filtering to server-side implementation
  - Improved performance for filtering large sets of security findings
  - Added support for filtering by status, severity, integration, and date range
  - Reduced client-side processing requirements

- **Optimized Sorting**: Changed posture findings sorting to use `lastDetectedAt` instead of `createdAt`
  - Provides more relevant ordering of findings based on when they were last detected
  - Improves visibility of recently detected security issues

### System Cleanup

- **Removed Unused Components**: Removed Webhook, Flow, Queue, and associated models
  - Streamlined codebase by removing unused features and components
  - Improved system maintainability and reduced complexity

## System Requirements

- Node.js 18.x or later
- PostgreSQL 12.x or later
