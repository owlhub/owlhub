# OwlHub Release Notes - v1.6.0

## Overview

OwlHub v1.6.0 introduces comprehensive VPC security scanning capabilities, enabling detection of various VPC configuration issues and potential security risks. This release builds upon the AWS security scanning features introduced in v1.5.0, expanding coverage to Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources.

## Key Features

### AWS Integration Enhancements

#### VPC Security Findings Detection

- **Comprehensive VPC Security Scanning**: Added detection for multiple VPC security and configuration issues:
  - Default VPC detection - Identifies default VPCs which may be over-permissive
  - Flow logs verification - Detects VPCs without flow logs enabled for network monitoring
  - Empty VPC detection - Identifies VPCs without any subnets
  - Unused resource detection - Finds VPCs without any ENI-provisioning resources
  - Internet Gateway attachment validation - Detects Internet Gateways not attached to any VPC
  - Internet Gateway routing verification - Identifies Internet Gateways not properly connected to route tables
  - Unused route table detection - Finds route tables not associated with any subnet
  - Blackhole route detection - Identifies route tables with blackhole routes that may indicate misconfiguration

### Code Improvements

- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Refactored VPC findings detection code for improved readability and maintainability
- **Optimized Route Table Processing**: Reordered unused route table detection logic for better consistency
- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in VPC resource scanning functions
